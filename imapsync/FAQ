http://imapsync.lamiral.info/FAQ

Unix versus Windows syntax.
There are several differences between Unix and Windows
in the command line syntax. 
- Character \ versus ^
- Character ' versus "


A) \ versus ^

On Unix shells you can write a single command on multiple lines
by using the escape character \ at the end of each line 
(except the last one). On Windows this character is ^

Unix example:

./imapsync \
   --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 \
   --host2 imap.trac.org --user2 bar --password2 secret2


Windows example:

imapsync ^
   --host1 imap.truc.org --user1 foo --password1 secret1 ^
   --host2 imap.trac.org --user2 bar --password2 secret2


Of course you can write the command on one only line without 
characters \ nor ^. I use them because the output is
better, no truncation, pretty print. It's just sugar.

In this FAQ I use \ for examples. Transcript to ^ if
you're on a Windows system.

B) ' versus " 

On Windows the single quote character ' doesn't work
like on Unix so in the examples of this FAQ the 
command containing single quotes ' will fail on Windows.
To fix it just replace single quotes ' by double quotes "

=======================================================================
Q. How to verify imapsync.exe I got is the right file bit per bit?

R. Use md5sum to check integrity of the file.
   Get md5sum.exe at http://etree.org/md5com.html

   md5sum imapsync.exe

   Then compare the checksum with the one given by the author.

=======================================================================
Q. Can I copy or sync Calendar or Contacts with imapsync?

R. No. It's because most IMAP servers don't get contacts and calendar 
events via IMAP. In other words, messages synced by imapsync from 
Calendar or Contacts folders are not used by email servers to set 
or get the contacts or calendars. 
No way via IMAP, no way via imapsync.
See next question.

=======================================================================
Q. How can I copy or synchronize Calendars or Contacts?

R1. It can't be done with imapsync.

R2. It can be done, depending on the email server softwares used.

a) From Exchange to Exchange, export contacts and calendar to
   PST format files on host1 and import them on host2.

b) From Gmail to Gmail, export and import calendars in ical format, 
   extension for those files is .ics.
   Contacts can be copied using a csv file. See the help page
   http://support.google.com/mail/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=1669027

c) Etc. Search the web. There's also specific tools and paid services.
   There's no silver bullet to migrate Calendars and Contacts,
   if you find one, tell me!

=======================================================================
Q. I need to migrate hundred accounts, how can I do?

R. If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little
shell program. Write a file called file.txt (for example)
containing users and passwords.
The separator used in this example is ";"

The file.txt file contains:

user001_1;password001_1;user001_2;password001_2
user002_1;password002_1;user002_2;password002_2
user003_1;password003_1;user003_2;password003_2
user004_1;password004_1;user004_2;password004_2
user005_1;password005_1;user005_2;password005_2
...

On Unix the shell program can be:

 { while IFS=';' read  u1 p1 u2 p2; do 
	imapsync --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 "$u1" --password1 "$p1" \
                 --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 "$u2" --password2 "$p2" ...
 done ; } < file.txt

On Windows the batch program can be:

  FOR /F "tokens=1,2,3,4 delims=; eol=#" %%G IN (file.txt) DO imapsync ^
  --host1 imap.side1.org --user1 %%G --password1 %%H ^
  --host2 imap.side2.org --user2 %%I --password2 %%J ...

The ... can be replaced by nothing or any supplementary imapsync option.

=======================================================================
Q. Where I can find old imapsync releases?

R. Search the Internet.

=======================================================================
Q. Where I can find free open and gratis imapsync releases?

R. Search the Internet.

Q. Is is legal to find imapsync gratis (or not) elsewhere?

R. Yes, the license permits it
   http://imapsync.lamiral.info/NOLIMIT

=======================================================================
Q. How "Facts and figures" are known on http://imapsync.lamiral.info/

R. To know wether a newer imapsync exists or not imapsync does a http 
   GET to http://imapsync.lamiral.info/VERSION
   Via the User-agent parameter it also send:

    * imapsync release
    * Perl version
    * Mail::IMAPClient version
    * Operating System

You can remove this behavior by adding option --noreleasecheck on the
command line (or by setting $releasecheck = 0 in the source code) 

=======================================================================
Q. I use --useuid which uses a cache in /tmp or --tmpdir, the hostnames
   host1 or host2 has changed but mailboxes are the same. Will imapsync
   generate duplicate messages on next runs?

R. Yes

Q. How can I fix this?

R. The cache path reflects hostnames or ip addresses, just change the
   directory names of host1 or host2. Use --dry to see if next runs
   will generate duplicates.
   By default the cache is like 

   /tmp/imapsync_cache/host1/user1/host2/user2/...

=======================================================================
Q. How can I speed up transfers?

R. By using --useuid imapsync avoid getting messages headers and build
   a cache. On Unix a good thing is to add also --tmpdir /var/tmp
   to keep the cache since /tmp is often cleared on reboot.

   imapsync ... --useuid 

R. Add also --nofoldersizes since the default behavior is to compute
   folder sizes. Folder sizes are useless for the transfer, just 
   useful to see what has to be done on each folder and guess when 
   the transfer will end (ETA).

R. Add also --nocheckmessageexists
   Since transfer can be long on a huge mailbox imapsync checks
   a message exist before copying it, but it takes time and 
   cpu on the host1 server. 
   --nocheckmessageexists is on by default since release 1.520

R. Add also --noexpungeaftereach if you use --delete but be warn
   that an interrupted transfer can loose messages on host2 in a 
   second run if you use a combination like

   imapsync ... --delete --noexpunge --noexpungeaftereach --expunge2

Notes about --useuid

Case where building the cache first is necessary (to avoid multiples transfers)

If you run again imapsync with --useuid on a transfer  already done without --useuid
then, to avoid messages be copied again, first run imapsync with --usecache
but without --useuid, example scenario:

A] Running with the default options, I began without --useuid 

1) First run with default options

  imapsync ...

Too slow, I want to speed up!

2) Build the cache

 imapsync ... --usecache

3) Speed up now

  imapsync ... --useuid

B] I began with --useuid from the first time

1) First run and next runs with --useuid

  imapsync ... --useuid


Inodes number issue


The cache is simple, it uses the file-system natively, 
it's just an empty file per message transfered.
When mailboxes are huge the cache can exhaust the number of inodes 
allowed in the filesystem, that's a limitation like size but less
often encountered.
On Unix, to predict whether your tmpdir filesystem used by imapsync 
will support the whole cache, just run the command "df -i /var/tmp", 
if /var/tmp is the --tmpdir argument.
On windows, search and drop me a note about how to count the number 
of files allowed in the filesystem. 
It seems FAT32 supports 268 435 445 clusters.

Choosing the number of inodes allowed by a filesystem can be done 
at the creation of it with "mkfs -N number-of-inodes ..."

imapsync can predict how many messages have to be synced with the 
option --justfoldersizes (no transfer will be done)

  imapsync ... --justfoldersizes


=======================================================================
Q. I see warning messages like 
"Host1 Sent/15 size 1428 ignored (no header so we ignore this message)"
What can I do to transfer those messages?

R1. Use --addheader option, it will add a header like
   "Message-Id: <15@imapsync>" and transfer the message on host2.
   Duplicates won't happen in next runs.

   imapsync ... --addheader

R2. Use --useuid then imapsync will avoid dealing with headers.

   imapsync ... --useuid

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, with --useuid or --usecache a problem occurs with long
   nested folder names. The error message is:
   "No such file or directory; The filename or extension is too long"

R. This comes from a Windows limitation on pathnames.
No more than 260 characters are allowed for pathnames.
See more details on page
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247.aspx#maxpath

Two workarounds to reduce the cache directory name:

1) Use --tmpdir "D:\\temp" or simply --tmpdir "D:"

Currently (until 1.568) there is a bug with --tmpdir "D:\\temp" or "D:".
Since character : is forbidden in Windows paths the directory is transform
to convert those characters and others () to character _
So "D:\\temp" becomes "D_\\temp". 

A fix is to change to D: before running imapsync and use --tmpdir "." 
like this in a batch file:

  D:
  cd \
  cd .\temp
  %~dp0\imapsync.exe ... --tmpdir "." 

This bug should be fixed in release 1.569

2) add two equivalent entries in the etc/hosts for host1 imap.truc.org 
and host2 imap.trac.org. 
If you map the ip of imap.truc.org just with the letter a 
and same thing for imap.trac.org then you gain characters

etc/hosts

192.168.12.1 a
192.168.55.3 b

Then use:

  imapsync --host1 a --host2 b ...

You can get the ip of a host with the ping command line
C:\> ping imap.truc.org

Fixing the long path problem directly in imapsync is in the TODO file.

=======================================================================
Q. How can I try imapsync with latest Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx perl module?

Three solutions at least.

R1 - Look at the script named "i3" in the tarball, it can be used to
     run imapsync with the included Mail-IMAPClient-3.35/ wherever you 
     unpacked the imapsync tarball

R2 Run:

   perl -MCPAN -e "install Mail::IMAPClient"

   or

   cpan -i Mail::IMAPClient

R3 If you want to install the Perl module locally in a directory

   - Download latest Mail::IMAPClient 3.xx at
     http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-IMAPClient/

   - untar it anywhere:
        tar xzvf Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx.tar.gz

   - Get any imapsync (latest is better).

   - run imapsync with perl and -I option tailing to use the perl
     module Mail-IMAPClient-3.xx. Example:

         perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-3.35/lib  ./imapsync ...

     or if imapsync is in directory /path/
        perl -I./Mail-IMAPClient-3.35/lib   /path/imapsync ...


=======================================================================
Q. How can I use imapsync with Mail::IMAPClient 2.2.9 perl module?

R. Mail::IMAPClient 2.2.9 is no longer supported.

=======================================================================
Q. I get "Out of memory" errors. How to fix that?

R. Usually "Out of memory" errors are related to old days,
to old Mail::IMAPClient module releases, before 3.26.
Look at imapsync output first lines to get the Mail::IMAPClient release used.
Then upgrade Mail::IMAPClient Perl module.

=======================================================================
Q. Can I use imapsync to migrate emails from pop3 server to imap server?

R1. No. 
You can migrate emails from pop server to imap server with pop2imap:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/pop2imap/

R2. Yes 
Many pop3 servers runs in parallel with an imap server on exactly 
the same mailboxes. They serve the same INBOX
(imap serves INBOX and several other folders, pop3 serves only INBOX)
So have a try with imapsync on the same host1.

=======================================================================
Q. Folders are not created on host2. What happens?

R. Do you use IMAP or POP3 with your client software?
It looks like you use POP3 instead of IMAP, POP3 has only INBOX.


=======================================================================
Q. I am interested in creating  a local clone of the IMAP on a LAN 
server for  faster synchronizations, email will always be delivered 
to the remote server and so the synchronization will be one way - from 
remote to local. How suited is imapsync for continuous one-way 
synchronization of mailboxes? Is there a better solution?

R. If messages are delivered remotely and you play locally with the
copy, in order to have fast access, then the synchronization can't
be one way. You may change flags, you may move messages in 
different folders etc.

A better tool with this scenario is offlineimap, 
designed for this issue, and faster than imapsync.

=======================================================================
Q. We have found that the sent time and date have been changed to the 
   time at which the file was synchronized. 

R. This is the case with:
   - Eudora
   - Outlook 2003
 but not with 
   - Mutt
   - Thunderbird
 and no longer with
   - Zimbra
   - Gmail


Eurora shows by default  the time the imap server received the email. I
think   it is  quite   a  wrong  behavior  since  the messages can have
traveled some time before the reception.

The sent time and date are given by the "Date:" header and it is set
most of the time by the MUA (Mail User Agent, Mutt, Eudora,
Thunderbird etc.).

imapsync does not touch any byte of messages unless told to do so
by an option. Messages on both parts should be identical
(some IMAP servers add or even change header lines).

Solutions: 
a) Use the --syncinternaldates option and keep using Eudora.
   But --syncinternaldates is now turn on by default so if you 
   encounter the issue then the solution is harder, depending
   on email client softwares and IMAP server softwares.

b) use --idatefromheader to set the internal dates on host2 same as the 
   "Date:" headers. It won't work if a) doesn't work.

c) In Maildir boxes, after the sync (too late...), use the script
learn/adjust_time.pl to change the internal dates from the "Date:" header.
(this a Unix fix using touch command)

d) Use a better email client or configure it in order it sorts messages
by sent date.


=======================================================================
Q. imapsync calculates 479 messages in a folder but only transfers 400 
   messages. What's happen?

R1. Unless --useuid is used, imapsync considers a header part 
   of a message to identify a message on both sides.
   By default the header part used is lines "Message-Id:" "Message-ID:" 
   and "Received:" or specific lines depending on --useheader 
   --skipheader. Whole header can be set by --useheader ALL

Consequences:

  1) Duplicate messages (identical header) are not transferred
     several times.

The result is that you can have more messages on host1 than on host2.

R2. With option --useuid imapsync doesn't use headers to identify
messages on both sides but it uses their imap uid. In that case
duplicates on host1 are transfered on host2.

=======================================================================
Q. How can I remove duplicates on a unique host

R. Just run imapsync on the same account with option --delete2,
   ie with host1 == host2 and user1 == user2

=======================================================================
Q. I need to log every output on a file named log.txt

R. Use redirections of both standard and error outputs "> log.txt 2>&1"

  imapsync ... > log.txt 2>&1

This syntax is available both on Windows and Unix.

=======================================================================
Q. I need to log every output on a file named log.txt and also to the 
   screen in order to keep seeing what's going on during execution

R. Use the tee program (also available on Windows)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_%28command%29
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/796476/displaying-windows-command-prompt-output-and-redirecting-it-to-a-file
http://code.google.com/p/wintee/


  imapsync ...  2>&1 | tee log.txt

=======================================================================
Q. Can I run more instances of imapsync in parallel on a Windows host.

R. Yes!

Q. Any performance issue?

You have to try and check the transfer rates, sum them up to
have a uniq numeric criteria. 
There is always a limit, depending on remote imap servers 
and the one running imapsync;
CPU, memory, Inputs/Outputs are the classical bottlenecks, 
the worst is the winner that sets the limit.

examples/sync_loop_windows.bat says
...
REM ==== Parallel executions ====
REM If you want to do parallel runs of imapsync then this current script is a good start.
REM Just copy it several times and replace, on each copy, the csvfile variable value.
REM Instead of SET csvfile=file.txt write for example
REM SET csvfile=file01.txt in the first copy
REM then also 
REM SET csvfile=file02.txt in the second copy etc.
REM Of course you also have to split the data contained in file.txt
REM into file01.txt file02.txt etc.
REM After that, just double-click on each batch file to launch each process


=======================================================================
Q.  I run multiple imapsync applications at the same time then get a
    warning "imapsync.pid already exists, overwriting it".
    Is this a potential problem when trying to sync multiple 
    IMAP account in parallel?

R1. No issue with the file imapsync.pid if you don't use its content
by yourself. 

This file can help you to manage multiple runs by sending signals 
to the processes (sigterm or sigkill) using their PID.
Each run can have its own pid file with --pidfile option.
The file imapsync.pid contains the PID of the imapsync process.
This file is removed at the end of a normal run.
You can safely ignore the warning if you don't use imapsync.pid file.

=======================================================================
Q. Couldn't create folder [trash] from [INBOX.trash]: 
   588 NO Mailbox already exists.

R. Some servers take care about character case in folder names, 
   some servers do not, like Exchange. Since non-respecting case 
   can merge two different folders into one then imapsync respects case. 

   For example, if a host1 server has a folder name called "trash"
   and the host2 server already has a folder "Trash" or "TRASH"
   then imapsync will try to create the folder "trash" on host2,
   because trash and Trash are different strings. But if host2
   does not respect character case it will consider folder "trash"
   already exists and will say it, that's the error message 
   reported by imapsync: "Mailbox already exists", message coming 
   from the server.

   The folder creation fails but messages are well transfered in
   so take a look at this warning, understand why it happens
   and it should be fine most of the time.

   To avoid this warning use --regextrans2 to map the folder names

   imapsync ...  --regextrans2 "s/^trash$/Trash/"

   If there are two folders Trash and trash on host1 then both
   will be merge into only one Trash folder on host2. 
   In case option --delete2 is used the regextans2 above becomes
   mandatory, otherwise imapsync will sync messages from the
   first Trash and then delete them when syncing trash.

=======================================================================
Q. Couldn't create [INBOX.Ops/foo/bar]: NO Invalid mailbox name: 
INBOX.Ops/foo/bar 

Let begin by an explanation.

Example:
sep1 = /
sep2 = .

imapsync reverts each separator automatically. 

a) All / character coming from host1 are converted to . (convert the separator)
b) All . character coming from host1 are converted to / (to avoid 
intermediate unwanted folder creation). 

So 
INBOX/Ops.foo.bar (Ops.foo.bar is just one folder name) will be translated to 
INBOX.Ops/foo/bar 

Sometimes the sep1 character is not valid on host2 (character "/" usually)

R. Try :

  --regextrans2 "s,/,X,g"

It'll convert / character to X 
Choose X as you wish: _ or SEP or 
any string (including the empty string).


=======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to sync also the UIDL of the POP3 server?

R. imapsync does not POP3 but I think you mean UID in IMAP.
   See next question.

=======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to sync also the UIDs of the IMAP server?

UIDs in IMAP are chosen and created by the servers, not by the clients,
imapsync is a client. So UIDs can not be synced by any method,
unless the server is duplicated as is.

=======================================================================
Q. The option --subscribe does not seem to work

R1. Use it with --subscribed

R2. There is also the --subscribe_all option that subscribe
to all folders on host2.

=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way we can specify a date range to sync emails? 
   If yes, can you please share an example?

Yes, with the --search option.

  imapsync ... --search "SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010"

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync retain the \Answered and $Forwarded flags?

R. It depends on the destination server.

a) If the destination server honors the "PERMAENTFLAGS \*" 
directive (meaning it accepts any flag) or no PERMAENTFLAGS at all 
then imapsync synchronizes all flags except the \Recent flag
(RFC 3501 says about \Recent flag "This flag can not be 
altered by the client.").

b) If the destination server honors the "PERMAENTFLAGS without the 
special "\*"  then imapsync synchronizes only the flags listed 
in PERMANENTFLAGS.

Some imap servers have problems with flags not beginning with
the backslash character \ 
(see next question to find a solution to this issue)


=======================================================================
Q. Is there a way to only sync messages with a specific flag set, 
for example, the \Seen flag? 

R. use --search 

  imapsync ... --search SEEN

or

  imapsync ... --search UNSEEN

or ...

The complete list of search things are listed below

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html

6.4.4.  SEARCH Command
...
      ALL
         All messages in the mailbox; the default initial key for
         ANDing.

      ANSWERED
         Messages with the \Answered flag set.

      BCC <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope
         structure's BCC field.

      BEFORE <date>
         Messages whose internal date (disregarding time and timezone)
         is earlier than the specified date.

      BODY <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the body of the
         message.

      CC <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope
         structure's CC field.

      DELETED
         Messages with the \Deleted flag set.

      DRAFT
         Messages with the \Draft flag set.

      FLAGGED
         Messages with the \Flagged flag set.

      FROM <string>
         Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope
         structure's FROM field.

      HEADER <field-name> <string>
         Messages that have a header with the specified field-name (as
         defined in [RFC-2822]) and that contains the specified string
         in the text of the header (what comes after the colon).  If the
         string to search is zero-length, this matches all messages that
         have a header line with the specified field-name regardless of
         the contents.

      KEYWORD <flag>
         Messages with the specified keyword flag set.

         This is functionally equivalent to "(RECENT UNSEEN)".

      NOT <search-key>
         Messages that do not match the specified search key.

      OLD

      ON <date>
         Messages whose internal date (disregarding time and timezone)
         is within the specified date.

      OR <search-key1> <search-key2>
         Messages that match either search key.

      RECENT
         Messages that have the \Recent flag set.

      SEEN

=======================================================================
Q. How to convert flags?

R. use --regexflag
For example to convert flag IMPORTANT to flag CANWAIT

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/IMPORTANT/CANWAIT/g" --debugflags

option --debugflags is usefull to see in details what imapsync
does with flags.

=======================================================================
Q. How to fix this error: BAD Invalid system flag \FORWARDED 

R. Filter flag \FORWARDED with

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/\\FORWARDED//g" 

=======================================================================
Q. How to convert flags with $ to \ character?

R. $ and \ are special characters we have to "escape" them.
For example to convert flag $label1 to \label1

  imapsync ... --regexflag "s/\$label1/\\label1/g" --debugflags

=======================================================================
Q. I need to keep only a defined list of flags, how can I do?
The destination imap server complains about bad flags (Exchange).

R1. Recent imapsync deals with this issue by filter with PERMANENTFLAGS
automatically.

R2. For example if you want to keep only the following flags
\Seen \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft
then use these magic --regexflag options (thanks to Phil):

 --regexflag 's/.*?(?:(\\(?:Answered|Flagged|Deleted|Seen|Draft)\s?)|$)/defined($1)?$1:q()/eg'

Analysis is left to the reader.

This one is longer and may be use with old perl (no /e regex extension):
 --regexflag 's/(.*)/$1 jrdH8u/' \
 --regexflag 's/.*?(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u)/$1 /g' \
 --regexflag 's/(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u) (?!(\\Seen|\\Answered|\\Flagged|\\Deleted|\\Draft|jrdH8u)).*/$1 /g' \
 --regexflag 's/jrdH8u *//'


======================================================================
Q. imapsync fails with the following error:
flags from : [\Seen NonJunk]["10-Aug-2006 13:00:30 -0400"]
Error trying to append string: 58 NO APPEND Invalid flag list

R. For some servers, flags have to begin with a \ character.
The flag "NonJunk" may be a invalid flag for your server 
so use for example:

imapsync ...    --regexflag "s/NonJunk//g"

Remark (thanks to Arnt Gulbrandsen): 
IMAP system flags have to begin with \ character.
Any other flag must begin with another character.
System flags are just flags defined by an RFC instead of by users.
Conclusion, some imap server coders don't read the RFCs (so do I).

Recent imapsync deals with this issue by filter with PERMANENTFLAGS
automatically.

=======================================================================
Q. Flags are not well synchronized. Is it a bug?

R. It happens with some servers on the first sync. 
Also, it was a bug from revision 1.200 to revision 1.207

Two solutions: 

* Run imapsync a second time. imapsync synchronizes flags on each run.

* Use option --syncflagsaftercopy. With this option imapsync will 
  also sync flags after each message transfer. Flags are already 
  synced during the transfer with the imap APPEND command but 
  option --syncflagsaftercopy does it again using the imap STORE 
  command.

=======================================================================
Q. On Unix, some passwords contain * and " characters. Login fails.
R. Use a backslash to escape the characters:

    imapsync ... --password1 \"password\" 

It works for the star * character,
I don't know if it works for the " character.

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, some passwords contain $ characters. Login fails.
R1. Enclose passwords between ""

    imapsync ... --password1 "zzz$zz$$z"

R2. Prefix each $ character with a ^ since ^ is the escape character
    on Windows

    imapsync ... --password1 zzz^$zz^$^$z

For a password that is exactly the 8 characters string $%&<>|^"
you have to enter

    imapsync ... --password1 "$%%&<>|^"^"

=======================================================================
Q. On Windows, some passwords begin with an equal = character. 
   Login fails. What can I do?

R. Use twice equals == characters instead; For example, if =secret 
   is the password then use:

    imapsync ... --password1 ==secret

or even

    imapsync ... --password1 "==secret"

=======================================================================
Q. With huge account (many messages) when it comes to reading the
destination server it comes out this error:
"To   Folder [INBOX.foobar] Not connected" 
What can I do?

R. May be spending too much time on the source server, the connection 
timed out on the destination server.
Try options --nofoldersizes 


=======================================================================
Q. imapsync failed with a "word too long" error from the imap server,
   What can I do?

R. Use imapsync release 1.172 or at least 1.166 with options
   --split1 500 --split2 500
   or a old old imapsync (before 1.94)

=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync support IMAP TLS?

R. Use --tls1 and/or --tls2 options

--tls1 tells imapsync to use tls on host1.
--tls2 tells imapsync to use tls on host2.


=======================================================================
Q. Does imapsync support IMAP over SSL (IMAPS)?

R. Yes natively since release 1.161. 
still, 2 ways, at least :

a) Use native --ssl1 and/or --ssl2 options

--ssl1 tells imapsync to use ssl on host1.
--ssl2 tells imapsync to use ssl on host2.


b) Use stunnel
   http://www.stunnel.org/
   Assuming there is an imaps (993) server on imap.foo.org,
   on your localhost machine (or bar machine) run :
       stunnel -c -d imap -r imap.foo.org:imaps
   or using names instead of numbers 
       stunnel -c -d 143 -r imap.foo.org:993
   then use imapsync on localhost (or bar machine) imap (143) port.
   If the local port 143 is already taken then use a free one, 10143.


=======================================================================
Q. On windows ssl use to work with imapsync.exe 1.536 or previous then
   an upgrade to next release makes it fail.

R. The I0::Socket::SSL can have SSL_version set by default to 
   "SSLv23:!SSLv2" but the auto-negociation can fail with 
   some ssl servers. Use --ssl1_SSL_version or 
   --ssl2_SSL_version to change SSL_version.

Try:

   imapsync ... --ssl1 --ssl1_SSL_version "SSLv3"

=======================================================================
Q: How to have an imaps server?

R. 
a) Install one 

b) or use stunnel :
   Assuming there is an imap (143) server on localhost
        stunnel  -d 993 -r 143 -f

c) or use stunnel on inetd
   imaps stream  tcp nowait cyrus /usr/sbin/stunnel -s cyrus -p /etc/ssl/certs/imapd.pem -r localhost:imap2

=======================================================================
Q: I'm trying to use imapsync on win32 for gmail and it requires ssl.
Imapsync appears to require IO::Socket::SSL. What can I do?

R1: use standalone imapsync.exe, it contains IO::Socket::SSL 
Perl module embedded.

R2: Module IO::Socket::SSL is available on Win32 
with Strawberry Perl.

=======================================================================
Q: Multiple copies when I run imapsync twice ore more.

R1. You can use option --useuid, imapsync then won't use header lines to
compare messages in folders. Keep in ming it uses a local cache.

  imapsync ... --useuid

R2. Multiple copies of the emails on the destination server. Some IMAP
servers (Domino for example) add some headers for each message
transfered. The message is transfered again and again each time you
run imapsync. This is bad of course. The explanation is that imapsync
considers the message is not the same since headers have changed (one
line added) and size too (the header part). 

You can look at the headers found by imapsync by using the --debug
option (and search for the message on both part), Header lines from
the source server begin with a "FH:" prefix, Header lines from the
destination server begin with a "TH:" prefix. Since --debug is very
verbose I suggest to isolate a email in a specific folder in case you
want to forward me the output.

The way to avoid this problem is by using options --skipheader and
--skipsize, like this (avoid headers beginning whith the string "X-"):

 imapsync ... --skipheader "^X-" --skipsize

To skip several headers you can use --skipheader one time

 imapsync ... --skipheader "^X-|^Status|^Bcc"

If you think you have too many header to avoid just use

 imapsync ... --useheader "Message-ID" --skipsize

Remark. (Trick found by Tomasz Kaczmarski)

Option --useheader "Message-ID" asks the server to send only header
lines begining with "Message-ID".  Some (buggy) servers send the whole
header (all lines) instead of the "Message-ID" line. In that case, a
trick to keep the --useheader filtering behavior is to use
--skipheader with a negative lookahead pattern :

 imapsync ... --skipheader "^(?!Message-ID)" --skipsize

 Read it as "skip every header except Message-ID".

======================================================================
Q. I am transferring mails from one IMAP server to another. I am using
   an SSL connection. Transferring huge mails (>10MB) takes ages.

R. try to transfer the mails without SSL connection. SSL code outside
   imapsync uses a memory buffer, which gets increased upon reading of
   mails by 4096 bytes. This creates a huge load on the host imapsync
   runs on by copying the memory buffers for every 4096 byte step.
   This does not occur without SSL.

(Written by Stefan Schmidt)

======================================================================
Q. What are --subscribe and --subscribed for, and how can they be used?

R. In the IMAP protocol each user can subscribe to one or more folders.
   Then he can configure its email software to just see his subscribed
   folders list. That's an IMAP feature.

   Knowing that, the imapsync help says:

  imapsync --help
  ...
  --subscribed           : transfers subscribed folders.
  --subscribe            : subscribe to the folders transferred on the 
                           host2 that are subscribed on host1.
  --subscribe_all        : subscribe to the folders transferred on the 
                           host2 even if they are not subscribed on host1.


======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude a folder hierarchy like "public"

R. Use:

--exclude "^public\."
or maybe
--exclude '^"public\.'

In the example given the character "." is the folder separator, you
can omit it. Just take the string as it appears on the imapsync
output line :

From folders list : [INBOX] [public.dreams] [etc.]


======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude only INBOX

R. Use:

  imapsync ... --exclude "^INBOX$" 

A good way to see what will be done is to first use:

  imapsync ...  --exclude "^INBOX$" --justfolders --nofoldersizes --dry

======================================================================
Q. I want to exclude folders matching SPAM no matter the case, 
   aka how to be case insensitive

R. Use:

  imapsync ... --exclude "(?i)spam" 

A good way to see what will be done is to first use:

  imapsync ... --exclude "(?i)spam" --justfolders --nofoldersizes --dry


======================================================================
Q. I want the --folder "MyFolder" option be recursive.

Two solutions:

R1. Use

--folderrec "MyFolder"

R2. Use --include "^MyFolder"
   Then the folder "MyFolder" and all its subfolders will be handled
   and only them.

======================================================================
Q. Migrating to Exchange 201O, messages get date of the transfer,
   this is bad for sorting and listing.

R1. Be sure to have at least Exchange 2010 SP2 Rollup 5
http://www.tribalchicken.com.au/15-technical/29-imapsync-exchange2010

R2. See also the Outlook side (thanks to Martin Hochreiter for this solution)
http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/archivenotworking.htm
by changing Archive to sent/receive date

It's often shorter to change one server than thousands clients
so R1 might be easier to do.

======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from or to Exchange 2003 with an admin/authuser 
   account?

R. Thomas Edgar wrote the following

In case you can glean something from this snippet which allowed us 
to migrate from Exchange 2003 t0 Cyrus Imap 2.4 (you would reverse 
the flow to go the other way):

  imapsync --dry --host1 ExchangeServer.mycompany.com \
    --user1 Some.User@mycompany.com --authuser1 ExchangeAdminAccount \
    --proxyauth1 --password1 '$pass_with_dollars$' \
    --host2 cyrusimapbackend.mycompany.com \
    --user2 SameOrDiffererentUser@mycompany.com \
    --authuser2 CyrusAdminAccount --proxyauth2

We also needed to:

- Ensure the Exchange Admin Acct had IMAP4 enabled in it's 
  profile (it initially didn't!)
- Ensure the Some.User Exchange Acct had IMAP4 enabled 
  in it's profile (it initially didn't!)
- Add the CyrusAdminAccount to admins line in /etc/imapd.conf
- Give CyrusAdminAccount lrswipkxtecda to the Cyrus Imap account 
  being migrated to (- or in your case, from)

In case you are not aware:

- It will prompt for a password if you don't supply it
- the domain part of the fully-qualified email could be 
  omitted in our case
- Use --debugimap when testing initial connectivity, if necessary

======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from or to Exchange 2007/2010 with an 
   admin/authuser account?
   
R. The tricks comes from Michele Marcionelli and Benjamin Priestman:

This doesn't work:
  imapsync ... --user2 user2 --authuser2 admin2 --password2 adminpassword2 ...

This might works:
  imapsync ... --user2 "domain\admin2\user2" --password2 adminpassword2 ...
or 
  imapsync ... --user2 "admin2@domain\user2" --password2 adminpassword2 ...

where "domain" is set be the user's UPN in Active Directory
or the NETBIOS or DNS name of the domain.

The exact format might vary depending on local configuration and you
should experiment with the different formats.

A little note from Michael Scherer. 
The previous workaround in the FAQ seems to be obsolete.
I can confirm that

  imapsync ... --host2 exchange_server --authmech2 PLAIN \
               --authuser2 admin@domain --user2 user_alias

is working without any glitches, running Exchange 2010 SP2 here.
Explanation, Exchange knows a) about a username 
and b) about a mailNickname which can be different to the username. 
As it seems you need to use the mailNickname (e.g. alias) defined 
for user2, not the username itself.
http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2004/03/31/105275.aspx


A little note from John Becker.
After you pointed out that I had issues with authorization, I realized that
as an admin user I don't have all the rights on the mailboxes.
So I added myself to the user mailbox with full rights.
I also changed the login type on the Exchange CAS to type 1, plain text.
The command that I used for imapsync is:
   imapsync ... ^
       --host2 exchange-server ^
       --user2 "windows-domain\admin-user\aaaa" ^
       --password2 admin-password ...

======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from or to Office 365 with an admin/authuser account?

Note from Yago Torres Fernandez:
(a working command using admin/authuser on host2 Office 365)

  imapsync ... --authuser2 user_admin@domain.com --user2 user_to_be_migrated@domain.com  ^
               --password2 XXXX --ssl2 --exclude "Shared Folders"     ^
               --regextrans2 "s#Trash$#Papelera#"  --regextrans2 "s#^Deleted Items$#Papelera#"

but previous in Office365 you must do something like that, using powershell:

  Add-MailboxPermission -identity user_to_be_migrated@domain.com -user user_admin@domain.com -accessrights fullaccess -inheritancetype all

======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from uw-imap with an admin/authuser account?

R. Use 

--user1="user*admin_user" --password1 "admin_user_password"


======================================================================
Q. How to migrate from cyrus with an admin account?

R. Use:
 
 imapsync ... \
   --authuser1 admin_user  ----password1 admin_user_password \
   --user1 foo_user --ssl1

In this case, --authmech1 PLAIN will be used by default since it
is the only way to go for now. So don't use --authmech1 SOMETHING
with --authuser1 admin_user, it will not work.
Same behavior with the --authuser2 option.

Do not forget the option --ssl1 since PLAIN auth is only
supported with ssl encryption most of the time. But it can
work without --ssl1 if PLAIN is permitted in normal use.

Here is an example:
 imapsync \
	--host1 server1 \
	--user1 joe \
	--authuser1 AdminAccount \
	--password1 AdminAccountPassword \
	--ssl1 \
	--host2 server2 \
	--user2 joe \
	--password2 joespassonserver2 \
	--exclude "^user\."

======================================================================
Q: How to migrate from Sun Java Enterprise System / Sun One / iPlanet /
Netscape servers with an admin account?

R: Those imap servers don't allow the typical use of --authuser1 to use an
administrative account. They expect the use of an IMAP command called
proxyauth that is issued after login in as an administrative account.

For example, consider the administrative account 'administrator' and your
real user 'real_user'. The IMAP sequence would be:

  OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE UIDPLUS
  CHILDREN BINARY UNSELECT LANGUAGE STARTTLS XSENDER X-NETSCAPE XSERVERINFO
  AUTH=PLAIN] imap.server IMAP4 service (Sun Java(tm) System Messaging
  Server ...))
  1 LOGIN administrator password
  1 OK User logged in
  2 PROXYAUTH real_user
  2 OK Completed

In imapsync, you can achieve this by using the following options:

  --host1 source.imap.server \
  --user1 real_user \
  --authuser1 administrator \
  --proxyauth1 \
  --passfile admin.txt

======================================================================
Q. Is there anyway of making imapsync purge the destination folder
   when the source folder is deleted?

R. No, that's too dangerous. May be coded in future release.

But if the source folder is empty (not deleted) and options --delete2
--expunge2 are used then the destination folder will be empty.

======================================================================
Q. Is it possible to synchronize all messages from one server to 
another without recreating the folder structure and the target server.

R. Yes.

For example, to synchronize all messages in all folders on host1
to folder INBOX only on host2:

1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 "s/(.*)/INBOX/" \
 --dry --justfolders

2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side, you should
   only have one: the classical INBOX.

4) Remove --justfolders


======================================================================
Q. I have moved from Braunschweig to Graz, so I would like to have my
   whole Braunschweig mail sorted into a sub-folder INBOX.Braunschweig 
   of my new mail account.

R.
1) First try (safe mode):

imapsync \
 ...
 --regextrans2 "s/INBOX(.*)/INBOX.Braunschweig\$1/" \
 --dry --justfolders

2) See if the output says everything you want imapsync to do, 
   --dry option is safe and does nothing real.
   
3) Remove --dry 
   Check the imap folder tree on the target side

4) Remove --justfolders

=======================================================================
Q. Give examples about --regextrans2

R. --regextrans2 is used to transform folder names

Remember that --regextrans2 applies after the default 
inversion prefix1 <-> prefix2 and sep1 <-> sep2

Examples: 

0) First try with --dry --justfolders options since imapsync shows the
   transformations it will do without really doing them. Then when
   happy with the output remove the --dry --justfolders options.

1) To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders:

    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'

2a) To sync all folders to INBOX:

  imapsync ... --regextrans2 "s/.*/INBOX/"


2b) To sync a complete account in a subfolder called FOO:
  
  a) Seperator is dot character "." and "INBOX" prefixes every folder
  
    --regextrans2 's/^INBOX(.*)/INBOX.FOO$1/'

  or:
  
  b) Seperator is slash character "/" and there is no prefix 
  
   --regextrans2 's#(.*)#FOO/$1#'
   
   or:

  c) Any separator, any prefix solution, FOO is the subfolder:

  It is a complicated line because every case is taken into account.
  Type it in one line (or with the \ at the end of first line on Unix shells.
   
   --regextrans2 's,${h2_prefix}(.*),${h2_prefix}FOO${h2_sep}$1,' \
   --regextrans2 's,^INBOX$,${h2_prefix}FOO{h2_sep}INBOX,'


3) to substitute all characters dot "." by underscores "_"
    --regextrans2 's/\./_/g'

4) to change folder names like this:
[mail/Sent Items] -> [Sent]
[mail/Test]       -> [INBOX/Test]
[mail/Test2]      -> [INBOX/Test2]

    --regextrans2 's#^mail/Sent Items$#Sent#' \
    --regextrans2 's#^mail/#INBOX/#'

=======================================================================
Q. I would like to move emails from InBox to a sub-folder called,
   say "2010-INBOX" based on the date (Like all emails received in the
   Year 2010 should be moved to the folder called "2010-INBOX").

R. 2 ways :

a) Manually:
------------

1) You create a folder INBOX.2010-INBOX

2) Mostly every email software allow sorting by date. In INBOX, you
   select from 1 January to 31 December 2010 messages with the shift key.
   (in mutt, use ~d)

3) Cut/paste in INBOX.2010-INBOX

b) With imapsync:
-----------------

imapsync ... \
--search 'SENTSINCE 1-Jan-2010 SENTBEFORE 31-Dec-2010'
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX$/INBOX.2010-INBOX/' \
--folder INBOX

=======================================================================
Q. I want to play with headers line and --regexmess but I want to leave
   the body as is

R. The header/body separation is a blank line so an example:
   --regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?! ^$))^Date:(.*?)$}{$1Date:$2\nX-Date:$2}gxms'

Will replace (HeaderBegin and HeaderEnd are not part of the header)

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

by

HeaderBegin
Message-ID: <499EF800.4030002@blabla.fr>
Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
X-Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:35:44 +0100
From: Gilles LAMIRAL <lamiral@linux-france.org>
HeaderEnd

This example just add an header line "X-Date:" based on "Date:" line.

=======================================================================
Q. My imap server does not accept a message and warns
   "Invalid header". What is the problem?

R. You fall in the classical mbox versus Maildir/ format
   problem. May be you use a misconfigured procmail rule.

A header beginning like the following one is in the mbox
format, header line 1 has no colon behind "From", header
lines 2 through N do have a colon :

From foo@yoyo.org  Sat Jun 22 01:10:21 2002
Return-Path: <foo@yoyo.org>
Received: ...

Any Maildir/ configured imap server may refuse this message since its
header is invalid. The first "From " line is not valid. It lacks a
colon character ":". To solve this issue you have several solutions

a) Remove manually this first "From " line for each message before
   using imapsync. 

b) Replace manually the whitespace by a colon in string "From " but you
   might end with two "From:" lines (just have a look at the other 
   header lines of the message)

c) Run imapsync with the following option (this replaces "From "by "From:"):
   --regexmess 's/\AFrom /From:/'

or may be better (no other "From:" collision):

d) Run imapsync with the following option (this replaces "From "by "X-om:"):
   --regexmess 's/\AFrom /X-om:/'

e) Run imapsync with the following option (this removes the whole "From " line):
   --regexmess 's{\AFrom\ [^\n]*(\n)?}{}gxms'

Solution e) is solution a) made by imapsync itself.
Solutions c) and d) keep "From " lines information
(normally it's useless to keep them)

Q. The contact folder isn't well copied. 
   How to copy the contact folder?

R. Forget the destination server (choose the same)
Change the script around line 1426
       # ITSD
       $new_id = $from->copy($t_fold,$f_msg);
       #$new_id = $to->append_string($t_fold,$string, $flags_f, $d);

and tried a copy of the mail instead an append_string. Because we are
using the same server, we can use $from->copy Therefore we seem to not
download and upload the message and therefore we do not have any
format issues. And now it works fine. (Thanks to Hansjoerg.Maurer)

=======================================================================
Q. From XXX to Exchange 2010/2013 or Office365

R. Here is a command line resume that solves most encountered issues when 
   migrating to Exchange or Office365. To understand or change the
   details you have to read next Q/R sections.

On Windows:

  imapsync ... ^
    --maxsize 10000000 ^
    --maxlinelength 9900 ^
    --regexflag "s/\\Flagged//g" ^
    --disarmreadreceipts


On Unix:

  imapsync ... \
    --maxsize 10000000 \
    --maxlinelength 9900 \
    --regexflag "s/\\Flagged//g" \
    --disarmreadreceipts


=======================================================================
Q. From XXX to Exchange 2013 or Office365 read receipts are all
  resent again after a sync. Even for old messages. How can I fix that?

R. imapsync can remove the header containing this read receipt request.

On Unix or Windows use:

  imapsync ... --disarmreadreceipts

Since read receipts should be sent for unseen messages that will go 
to a seen state after the migration, you could be strict and apply 
the regex only to seen messages. 
Selecting seen message can be done with:

  imapsync ... --search1 "SEEN" --disarmreadreceipts

Of course a second run has to be run without the --regexmess for 
unseen messages:

  imapsync ... --search1 "UNSEEN" 

If fact --disarmreadreceipts is just an option equivalent to:

  --regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?! ^$))^Disposition-Notification-To:(.*?)$}{$1X-Disposition-Notification-To:$2}igxms' 

That regex prefixes the header Disposition-Notification-To with an X-
so that it becomes inactive.

Thanks to David Karnowski for pointing and solving this issue.

=======================================================================
Q. From XXX to Exchange 2010/2013 or Office365 I get this error message
   sometimes: "BAD Command Argument Error 11"

R. This error message comes from Exchange IMAP server when it 
   encounters any problem. Most of the time it is one of the following:

  * Some messages are bigger than the size limit. 10 MB by default
    on Exchange. It can be upped by configuration for Exchange.
    If you can't configure this limit then use option
    --maxsize 10000000 for 10 MB, change it if needed) to tell
    imapsync to skip those messages.
    This value is 25 MB by default for Office365 --maxsize 25000000

  imapsync ... --maxsize 10000000 # 10 MB for Exchange

  imapsync ... --maxsize 25000000 # 25 MB for Office365
  

  * Quota reached. The whole account is full.
    It can be upped by configuration.

  * Some messages have some lines too long. Use option --maxlinelength
    to skip messages whose max line length is over a number of bytes.
    --maxlinelength 1000 is a RFC2822 must but most server support
    higher values. Exchange supports 9900:

  imapsync ... --maxlinelength 9900 

Have also in mind that Exchange closes the connection after 10 errors
encountered so you might also see "BYE Connection closed" errors from
Exchange, which means Exchange leaves the session and say goodbye,
come back later. Rerun a sync then.

=======================================================================
Q. From XXX to Exchange 2010 or 2013 or Office365 the flag Flagged does 
   not seem to be well synced.

R. Use the following trick. Run imapsync twice, one with --regexflag
   and one without, like this:

1) imapsync ... --regexflag "s/\\Flagged//g"
2) imapsync ...

You can add --debugflags if you want to see what imapsync gets and 
does in details with flags.

The magic of this trick is on ignoring the \Flagged flag on the first 
sync and setting it on the second sync, with STORE instead of APPEND.
This Exchange bug seems that Exchange gets and sets well the Flagged 
flag with APPEND in IMAP but then it forgets it with other protocols;
With STORE it sets and gets the "\Flagged" flag everywhere.

Thanks to Dave Murray and Simon Savva for reporting and solving 
this issue.

=======================================================================
Q. Synchronizing from XXX to Gmail  

R. There are some details to get the special [Gmail] sub-folders
   right. Here's an example of migrating an old "Sent" folder to
   Gmail's structure:

imapsync --host1 mail.oldhost.com \
         --user1 my_email@oldhost.com \
         --password1 password \
         --host2 imap.gmail.com \
         --user2 my_email@gmail.com \
         --password2 password \
         --ssl2 \
         --exitwhenover 500000000 \
         --addheader \
         --exclude "\[Gmail\]$"           \
         --regextrans2 "s/[ ]+/_/g"       \
         --regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g"       \
         --regextrans2 "s/['\"\\\\]/_/g"  \
         --regextrans2 "s,^Sent$,[Gmail]/Sent Mail," 

Explanations:

--ssl2 is mandatory since Gmail only supports imap ssl connections.

--exitwhenover 500000000 option is here to avoid locking when 
transfers exceed maximum limit. 
See http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1071518
--exitwhenover is not mandatory in the sense you may be able to
use an upper value than 500 MB without disconnections; I don't
know the hard value, it seems to vary, so just have some tries
and report me what you discover in case you detect something.

The --addheader option is there because "Sent" folder messages 
sometimes lack the "Message-Id:" and "Received:" headers needed 
by imapsync to identify messages (only when --useuid is not used). 
So option --addheader adds a "Message-Id" header consisting of
the imap UID of the message on the host1 folder, like
"Message-Id: 12345@imapsync".

--exclude "\[Gmail\]$" is there to avoid a small examine/select error:
"Could not examine: 43 NO [NONEXISTENT] Unknown Mailbox: [Gmail] 
(now in authenticated state) (Failure)".

--regextrans2 "s/[ ]+/_/g" is there to convert blank characters not 
accepted by gmail to character _ underscore. In fact only leading
and trailing blank characters are problems with gmail, and
also successive blanks ending with the IMAP error 
"NO [CANNOT] Folder contains excess whitespace (Failure)"
If you want to change only leading and trailing blank characters
then use instead:
--regextrans2 "s,(/|^) +,\$1,g" --regextrans2 "s, +(/|$),\$1,g"

--regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g" is mandatory.  It converts, since
not accepted by gmail, character ^ to character _ underscore.

--regextrans2 "s/['\"\\\\]/_/g" is optional. It converts 
characters ' or " or \ to character _ underscore.

--regextrans2 "s,^Sent$,[Gmail]/Sent Mail," is to transform the
folder name "Sent" and adapt it to Gmail "Sent Mail" folder.
If you're using a different language in Gmail you might adapt
this example with the folder name translated, an example in French:

imapsync ...
	 --regextrans2 "s,^Messages envoy&AOk-s$,[Gmail]/Messages envoy&AOk-s," \


You can add --folder "INBOX.Sent" in the example in case
you want to sync only the "Sent" folder.

You can select folders exported to imap within the gmail preferences,
unselect some  "System labels", depending on your needs.

The "All Mail" archive pseudo-folder should be updated automatically.



=======================================================================
Q. Some of the folders are getting created with [IMAP] prefix on Google
side. How to stop creating folder with this prefix?
Any switch we can use? e.g. [IMAP]/Archive

R. No switch in imapsync since [IMAP]/ prefix is done by Gmail,
   it might be configurable with Gmail parameters.

=======================================================================
Q. Synchronizing from Gmail to XXX 

R. Gmail needs SSL 

./imapsync \
           --host1 imap.gmail.com \
           --user1 gilles.lamiral@gmail.com \
           --password1 gmailsecret \
           --host2 localhost
           --user2 tata \
           --password2 tatasecret \
           --ssl1 \
           --exitwhenover 2500000000 \
           --useheader="X-Gmail-Received" \
           --useheader "Message-Id" \
           --skipcrossduplicates \
           --folderfirst "Work" \
           --folderfirst "Friends" \
           --folderlast  "CanWait" \
           --folderlast  "[Gmail]/All Mail"


Explanations:

--ssl1 is mandatory since Gmail only supports imap ssl connections.

--exitwhenover 2500000000 option is here to avoid locking when 
transfers exceed maximum limit. 
See http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1071518
--exitwhenover is not mandatory in the sense you may be able to
use an upper value than 2.5 GB without disconnections; I don't
know the hard value, it seems to vary, so just have some tries
and report me what you discover in case you detect something.

--useheader="X-Gmail-Received" --useheader "Message-Id" are not
mandatory. I use them because I found (several years ago, it may
have changed) that Gmail always adds a different header 
"X-Gmail-Received:" to all messages it gets. So the identification
by imapsync can not fall using this header. "Message-Id" is there
for safety about this Gmail rule.


If your destination imap server doesn't like "[Gmail]" name, just add
option:
           --regextrans2 's/\[Gmail\]/Gmail/'

You can select folders exported to imap within the gmail preferences,
unselect all "System labels".

--exitwhenover option is here to avoid locking when transfers 
exceed maximum limit. 
See http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1071518

--skipcrossduplicates is optional but it can save Gigabytes of hard
disk memory. Within imap protocol, Gmail presents Gmail labels as 
folders so a message labeled "Work" "ProjectX" "Urgent" ends up 
in three different imap folders "Work" "ProjectX" and "Urgent"
after an imap sync. --skipcrossduplicates prevent this behavior.

An issue with --skipcrossduplicates is that the first label synced
by imapsync goes to its corresponding folder and other labels are
ignored. This way, at least you can choose what labels have the 
priority by using the --folderfirst option. For example
--folderfirst "Work" will sync messages labeled "Work" before
messages labeled "CanWait" or "Urgent". By default imapsync 
syncs folders (Gmail labels) using the classical alphanumeric order.

--folderlast "CanWait" will sync only messages that have the
label CanWait and only it.

--folderlast "[Gmail]/All Mail", in conjunction with option 
--skipcrossduplicates, will only put in "[Gmail]/All Mail"
the messages that are not labeled at all.

Q. How to use XOAUTH to globally authenticate gmail users?
   The XOAUTH code and this FAQ item come from Eduardo Bortoluzzi
   Thanks Eduardo!

R. The goal of OAUTH is to migrate all users from/to Google Apps 
   Premier Edition without knowing their passwords.

   The global password is available at the Google Apps control panel, 
   at Advanced Tools -> Manage OAuth domain key.

./imapsync \
    --host1 imap.gmail.com --ssl1 \
    --user1 foo@lab3.dedal.br \
    --password1 secret1 \
    --authmech1 XOAUTH \
    --host2 imap.gmail.com --ssl2 \
    --user2 bar@lab3.dedal.br \
    --password2 secret2 \
    --authmech2 XOAUTH

Google Apps is a paid service, but you can try it for 30 days without any cost.

Some notes about configuring the Google Apps XOAUTH:

 On "Advanced Tools > Manage OAuth domain key > Two-legged OAuth access control" 
    the "Allow access to all APIs" must be checked 
    (https://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?answer=162105)

 OR

 On "Advanced Tools > Manage third party OAuth client access", 
    the configured costumer key must have the scope 
    "https://mail.google.com/" configured 
    (https://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?answer=162106).

=======================================================================
Q. From or to HMailServer version 4.4.1.

R. You have to add prefix and separator manually because  4.4.1 doesn't
honor the NAMESPACE imap command.

Example for host1:

imapsync ... \
         --prefix1 "" --sep1 .

No specific option for HMailServer 5.3.3 since NAMESPACE is supported.

Maybe --subscribe_all will help you to see all migrated folders.


=======================================================================
Q. Synchronizing from SmarterMail to XXX

imapsync --host1 imap.d1.org --user1 joe --password1 secret1 --sep1 "/" \
         --host2 imap.d2.org --user2 joe --password2 secret2  \
         --prefix1 ""  \
         --regextrans2 "s#Sent Items$#Sent#" \
         --dry --justfolders

Maybe add other --regextrans2 to change folder names and see the result.
When satisfied, run without --dry --justfolders


=======================================================================
Q. Synchronizing from Yahoo to XXX

R. Use --host1 imap.mail.yahoo.com --sep1 '/'

./imapsync \
	--host1 imap.mail.yahoo.com \
        --user1 billy \
        --password1 secret \
        --host2 XXX \
        --user2 billy \
        --password2 secret \
        --sep1 '/'

Can also add --ssl1 to gain encrypted transfer from yahoo.
SSL seems to be mandatory for yahoo (since november 2011)

Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail but the tool copies everything in /home/user, how
   can i avoid that?

   imapsync ... --include '^mail'

R. or (better)
   imapsync ... --subscribed --subscribe


=======================================================================
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are under
   /home/user/mail directory.  When imapsync creates the folders in
   the new cyrus imap server, it makes a folder "mail" and below that
   folder puts all the mail folders the user have in /home/user/mail,
   i would like to have all those folders directly under INBOX.

R. Use 
   imapsync ... --regextrans2 's/^mail/INBOX/' --dry
   look at the simulation and if all transformations seem
   good then remove the --dry option.


=======================================================================
Q. Migrating from Groupwise to Cyrus

R. By Jamie Neil:

I eventually managed to get the mail to migrate without errors using the 
following options:

--sep1 /
  - doesn't report separator so has to be set explicitly.

--nosyncacls
  - doesn't support ACLs.

--skipheader '^Content-Type'
  - MIME separator IDs seem to change every time a mail is accessed so 
    this is required to stop duplicates.

--maxage 3650
  - some messages just don't seem to want to transfer and produce the 
    perl errors I mentioned before. This prevents the errors, but the
    bad messages don't transfer.

Even though the mail migrated OK, there are a couple of gotchas with 
Groupwise IMAP:

1) Some of the GW folders are not real folders and are not available
to IMAP, the main problem one being "Sent Items". I could find no way
of coping the contents of these folders. The nearest I got was to
create a "real" folder and copy/move the sent items into it, but
imapsync still didn't see the messages (I think because there is
something funny about the reported dates/sizes).

It think this problem has been rectified in GW6.5.

2) The "skipheader '^Content-Type'" directive is required to stop 
duplicate messages being created. GW seems to generate this field on
the fly for messages that have MIME separators and so it's different
every time.

3) Version 6.0.1 of the Groupwise Internet Connector sucks. I was 
getting server aborts when I pushed it a bit hard! I eventually had to
upgrade to 6.0.4 which seems to be a lot more stable.

Q. From any to Exchange2007 

Several problems:
- Big messages: increase the "send- and receive-connector" 
  in exchange2007 to 40 MB.

R. 2 solutions

R1. With imapsync (only partial success)
--skipsize --skipheader 'Received' \
--regexmess 's{\A(.*?(?!^$))^Date:(.*?)$}{$1Date:$2\nReceived: From; $2}gxms'
Any user having time to spend to debug Exchange2007 with imapsync
is welcome.

R2. Other solution
Two users succeeded by using "MS Transporter Suite" (which is closed
expensive non-free software).

======================================================================
Q. From FirstClass to XXX
   http://www.firstclass.com/

R. Migrating from FirstClass is not easy because FirstClass, strangely, 
   does not show all messages via IMAP. To make it show all messages,
   a trick, painful to follow by hand, is moving emails 
   out and back in, for each folder. May be it can be done by a script.

  FirstClass releases prior to release 12 do not shows the "Sent" 
  folder in IMAP but FirstClass release 12 shows it.
  I advice you to upgrade to FirstClass release 12 before leaving it
  with imapsync or another imap tool.

Here is a command line used to migrate from FirtClass release 12:

  imapsync ... \
    --tmpdir /var/tmp --usecache \
    --useheader Message-ID \
    --idatefromheader \
    --addheader \
    --regextrans2 "s,(/|^) +,\$1,g" --regextrans2 "s, +(/|$),\$1,g" \
    --regextrans2 "s/[\^]/_/g"       \
    --regextrans2 "s/['\"\\\\]/_/g"  \
    --regextrans2 "s,&AC8-,-,g" \
    --regextrans2 "s,&APg-,oe,g" \
    --noabletosearch
