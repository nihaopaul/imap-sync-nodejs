NTLM Authentication Scheme
==========================

This module implements the NTLM authentication mechanism.  It can be
used to perform NTLM style authentication for any desired protocol.

The module works well with the Mail::IMAPClient module in the
"authenticate" method, however I had to make a change to that method
for it to work.  The following line (2511 in version 2.1.4):

			($code) = $o->[DATA] =~ /^\+ (.*)$/ ;

needed to be changed to:

			($code) = $o->[DATA] =~ /^\+(.*)$/ ;

as the initial NTLM challenge is empty.

This module also works well with LWP::Authen::Ntlm , allowing LWP::UserAgent 
and/or WWW::Mechanise to automate/browse/fetch/etc remote Microsoft Windows 
servers running NTLM authentication. 
Example use is like this(note the fact that NTLM.pm is NOT explicitly used!):

    use WWW::Mechanize;
    $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new(keep_alive=>1);
    $mech->no_proxy('my.server'); 
    $mech->credentials('my.server:80', '', "my_domain\\my_user", my_pass);
    $response = $mech->get( $url  );

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
