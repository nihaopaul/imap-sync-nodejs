INSTALLATION
============
1. Download Mail::IMAPClient module
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-IMAPClient/

2. Read this README

3. This module has a number of dependencies on other Perl modules
   available from CPAN.  If any modules are missing, appropriate
   warnings will be generated in the following step.

4. Prepare to build this module and install any prerequisite modules:

    perl Makefile.PL

5. (OPTIONAL) For extended tests during 'make test', create a file
   'test.txt' in the top level directory of this distribution (the
   same directory as the Makefile.PL, etc.).  This file must contain
   an IMAP server name or IP (server=...), a user account (user=...),
   and password a (passed=...).  A port (port=....) and an
   authentication mechanism to be used (authmechanism=...) can also be
   specified.

Example:

--- BEGIN: test.txt ---
server=localhost
user=mytestuser
passed=mypassword
port=143
--- END: test.txt ---

   NOTE: When testing is completed, be sure to remove test.txt (either
   by hand or by 'make clean').

6. Build, test and install this module:

    make
    make test
    (sudo) make install
