TEXT_BODY="Several improvements to reach better usability. Authentication cram-md5 is not used by default (too few server support it). Issues from servers changing or adding header are avoided. Now imapsync has a way to handle efficiently no header in messages. The imap server dkimap is  supported (dkimap isn't a uid capability server). Added NTLM authentication with domain. Added --minsize option to transfer messages bigger than a given size. Added memory consumption measurement to compute how much concurrent imapsync can run in parallel on a system. Imapsync is no longer gratis from the home page."
