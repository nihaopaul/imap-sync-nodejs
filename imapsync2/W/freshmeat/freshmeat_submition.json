    "changelog": "Since last public release 1.350 several improvements have been made to reach a better usability. By default, authentication cram-md5 is not used (too few server support it) so --noauthmd5 option becomes useless. To avoid  issues from servers changing or adding header option  --useheader Message-Id is on by default too. Now imapsync has a way to handle efficiently no headers in messages (take first 2KB body). The imap server dkimap is now supported (it was not because dkimap is not a uid capability server). NTLM authentication with domain is supported. Added --minsize option to transfer messages bigger than a given size. Added memory consumption measurement to compute how much concurrent imapsync can run in parallel on a system. Imapsync is no longer gratis from the home page. Imapsync license has not changed, it is still a WTFPL software. Thanks again to the freshmeat guy who corrects my bad and poorly English!"
